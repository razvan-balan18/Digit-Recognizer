# Digit-Recognizer


Handwritten digit recognizer using a simple neural network.
I made this project from scratch in Python using the MNIST database.

To learn as much as possible, i decided to use just numpy and some matplotlib for visualization.
Everything else is just math.

At the moment i finished the project it has an accuracy of 85% which is relatively low, and i plan on working on it until it reaches at least 95%.
